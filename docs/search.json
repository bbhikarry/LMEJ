    "text": "If you’re here it means you have already read this page on the logic for an intervention in Lambeau. We shall now look into the key methodology - the work that gives us credence to enter the community; the Vulnerability Assessment.\nA Vulnerability assessments (VA) is guided by information gathered via three considerations:\nSocial environment has impact potential for a community’s vulnerability. To use a scenario: A well kept, god fearing, fenced burg with parent/teach assocs; with strong but positive diversions like sport, aversion to having rumshops etcetera under the family bedroom - are exemplary aspects of attempts to provide a good social environment. The initial outlook here says the above social environment is less prone, carries less potential for negative social impact: Hence, is less vulnerable in the face of current and future climate change stress.\nNow say we have …. a society exposed to (f.e) high crime vs one with low crime, one will have strong business presence, leading to jobs nearer to home vs rampant poverty. Both situations give rise to attendant ills. However one can be said to be more exposed and therefore has less adaptive capacity Thus is more vulnerable to effects wrought due to climate change [variability].\nClimate as it changes will also affect Nature within the study area. A vulnerability assessment watches (examples) Poverty; affecting land use (hillside agric using bad techniques ), deforestation, erosion, strong - as opposed to compromised biodiversity, soil and water retention aspects that can affect the local ecosystem. In short the study area (and sometimes places outside of it) with an intact natural environment may be said to have less exposure than one that is Exposed. In this case a natural environment either has less Adaptive capacity or it does not.\nThe following diagram attempts to show the contributory factors that determine vulnerability to climate variability. Bear in mind they often overlap.\nList of tools which may be deployed for carrying out the Lambeau PVA**\nOf the eight shown, what’s the least we can employ to obtain enough material to substantiate a case for getting help to Lambeau? All of the list of add to the knowledge-base though the 3D model may prove costly, cumbersome and may not have use afterward. Let’s look at each one."

    "text": "Spatial mapping or GIS\nUse a wide format printout (or have a good hand drawn outline map made) that the target group can circulate around. (Requires a suitable table) Have the target group enter the geography as they know it.\nFor example people could ‘place’ the school’s location, the fish retail outlet, the Pascal village stream, the hotel ruin, the bridges, the Shore Things restaurant and curio shoppe. All together such information - all very different things, comprise a spatial mapping exercise.\n\n3D modeling\nParticipatory three-dimensional modelling (P3DM) is another tool that uses local knowledge to assess vulnerability and identify possible adaptation strategies. It facilitates the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders, such as community members, government ministers, technical persons, civil society and academia, in the process of assessing vulnerabilities in the areas where they live and work.\nThe three-dimensional model can be used to depict the past, present and future and is therefore a good tool to show the impacts of climate change and to plan for adaptation and resilience building. As the model is produced to scale, the information collected can be digitised and placed into a geographic information system (GIS) and used by a variety of planners to support decision-making. P3DM however, takes time to complete (typically between two weeks and two months).\n\n\nPhoto journaling\nIs effective for our purposes as it allows for anyone (with a camera) to submit content. Allows for non current imagery to be display - which can also substantiate the historical timeline.\nA photo journal is easy for us to share and easy for the receivers to consume when they do get it. Can also be used in other exercises over time.\n\n\nVideo journaling\nParticipatory video (PV) is a tool that can be used by community stakeholders to make their own video to tell the story of their vulnerability and capacity to adapt to climate change. It gives the community a direct voice using a very powerful communication medium that brings their challenges and issues alive for a wider audience.\nPV can be useful for supporting advocacy, building consensus and exchange of ideas and experiences between groups or communities, including facilitating dialogue between groups, communities and stakeholders from outside the community. It can also be used for participatory monitoring and evaluation.\nPV is not traditional documentary film-making. Community stakeholders are fully involved in all stages of the production of the video. The persons involved in the PV often move from being the “object of study” to become the “subject” of the process.\nThis enhances the participants’ motivation and attitude to take action. They decide what the issues and questions are, who should be part of the process, who needs to hear the messages and how those messages should be crafted and possible solutions.\nAlso includes creating a storyboard, capturing video clips of interviews with stakeholders and scene shots and direct editing of the video clips. The final product may take the format of a documentary, a skit or a music video.\n\n\n Surveys\nSurveys can provide insights into people’s level of awareness of climate change and its impacts, the types of strategies for addressing impacts, and the various resources available in a community or sector.\nYou can ask questions that provide quantitative information (numbers and facts), such as household size, sources and level of income, or how often a community is affected by a particular climate hazard.\nYou should also include questions that provide qualitative information (descriptions), such as perceptions and attitudes about an issue.\nSurveys, unlike semi-structured interviews and focus groups, typically use a rigid format where participants are asked the same questions in the same order. This fixed format ensures reliable and comparable information across the surveys.\nSurveys can be administered in a variety of ways, for example face-to-face, online (Meet, Zoom etc), via telephone or via mail or email).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for developing survey questions\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep them simple. Avoid using technical terms or jargon that may be poorly understood by respondents.\nBe concise. Avoid long questions with multiple elements. They can be confusing as respondents don’t know which part to answer.\nAvoid leading questions that direct participants to a particular answer. Instead of giving their honest opinion, participants will choose what they think is a good answer for you.\nAvoid loaded terms. Loaded terms, like corruption or fines, can result in a negative reaction regardless of the question asked.\nKeep the survey short: The quality of the responses will decline if it takes too long to get to the end of the survey.\nPilot the survey on a small scale before finalising and launching the full survey. This enables you to check that your selected interviewers have the necessary skills and respondents find the questions clear are providing the type of information you need.\n\n\n\nHere is the link to one survey we used in Lambeau during the 2017 VA\nAnd here is the link to the forthcoming LM4eJ survey This link is not active at this point but it will take you to a Google Form soon …\n\n\nLivelihood Analysis\nLivelihood vulnerability analysis is a systematic, participatory approach for analysing the vulnerability of a community’s livelihoods to climate change. It aims to engage the community in identifying how climate change is affecting their livelihoods, the drivers of vulnerability and ways to build resilient and sustainable livelihoods.\nThe analysis focuses not just on how community members earn a living, such as fishing, farming or tourism but also focuses on the wider concept of livelihoods assets and wellbeing. It also examines the opportunities and assets available to the community, and the different policies and institutions shaping these opportunities.\nThrough understanding the livelihood activities and assets within a community, you can analyse how they will be affected by climate change and the factors that make them more or less vulnerable. You can identify ways that communities can respond using their available assets. Additionally, you can identify entry points for building adaptive capacity and resilience into the future.\n\n\nValue Chain Analysis\n“Identifying key stages in an enterprise. It shows for example the steps from sourcing raw material for the product (and/or service), to sale, to the final consumer. It is used to improve the bottom line of an enterprise by adding value to its product or service” (Arline, 2016).\nNext up …. Objectives and Activities"

(Section 6/Subsection 6.5. RECORD KEEPING AND PREPARATION OF CLAIMS (Page 46) Trinidad and Tobago have to make a claim to the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund in accordance with the 1992 Protocol of the Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage.\nThis means there may be money coming in at some point and Lambeau needs to be positioned to collect some of it - And the only way to justify their cause, their right, is to make a credible case/ a scientific argument.\nThe litigation strategy is intended to keep the issue alive And to place the affected community at the top of the list for compensation. Obviously Government will extract its expenditure (fronted) towards the 2024 cleanup but the restoration should be managed by Tobago/ i.e. the Lambeau community.\nWhat is unsaid is, Environment Tobago in empowering the cause of the Lambeau community is living up to its role as an advocate for environmental justice. Remember, Lambeau did not cause the February oil spill. They are simply victims of an injustice.\nHow  does Environment Tobago benefit the organisation or it members in oil spill involvement, beyond ‘just’ simply cleaning coast and wiping oil of wildlife?\nThis NGO’s strategic plan provides guidance (or strongly suggests) that we need an item that can generate income for the operations of the group: Preferably in a niche that is not overly popular and therefore highly competitive.\nThe oil spill has occurred at time when Environment Tobago has to hand, capability to assess and guide the Lambeau community to a place less vulnerable to unplanned disaster. And to greater appreciation of the Risks they face from the rapid onset of changing climate, given their proximity to the open ocean.\nIn short, the opportunity provided by the oil spill is something ET is uniquely placed to capture.

There will be other groups that can be impacted so the exhaustive list should be generated by consultation with the community and stakeholders - wherever found.\nThis opens up the option of pressing litigation against the THA. It also mean proving any arguments we make.\nWe’d want to argue the event could have been forestalled had the coast guard been doing their work. As the Prime Minister the Hon. Keith Rowley is on record as admitting the TTCG is having vessel issues. We could also make a case that State is in dereliction of duty. For which we use satellite tracking data that ‘put’ the leaking barge off Trinidad but well within our waters prior to dropping in at Cove.\nThe core argument is that the disaster could have been prevented had State’s resources functioned when tested in early February.

    "text": "Definition of adaptation\nClimate Change Adaptation (CCA) is on of the two central approaches in the international climate change process. The term refers to adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits opportunities. Potential beneficial opportunities associated with climate change are for example; longer growing seasons or increased yields in some regions. see Mitigation\n\n\nNeed for adaptation\nThe world’s climate is changing and will continue to change at rates unprecedented in recent human history. The risks associated with these changes are real and are already happening in many systems and sectors essential for human livelihood.\nThese include water resources, food security, coastal zones and health. Developing countries, especially those that are least developed are the most vulnerable to these risks.\nIn the most susceptible communities the impacts of climate change pose a direct threat to people’s very survival. The devastating effects of extreme events, temperature increases and sea level rise will worsen with consequences for all of us, particularly the poor.\n\n\nDefinition of Climate change impact\nClimate change impacts refer to the effects of climate change on natural and human systems.\n\n\n## Cause and Effect Diagram: Global Impact  \n\n# load package\n## library(qcc)\n\n\nqcc::cause.and.effect (cause = list(Water = c(\"Supply\", \"Quality\"),\n                                    Agriculture = c(\"Farms\", \"Fisheries\"),\n                                    Settlements = c(\"Cities\", \"Towns\"),\n                                    Infrastructure = c(\"Roads\",\"Bridges\", \"Ports\"),\n                                    Health = c(\"Disease\", \"Wellbeing\", \"Displacement\"),\n                                    Ecological = c( \"Structure\", \"Timing\", \"Range\")),\n                       \n                       title = \"Global Climate Change\",\n                       effect = \"Impacts\",\n                       cex = c(1, 0.8, 1), font = c(1, 3, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResilience\nResilience in the context of climate change refers to the ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity for self-organisation, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.\n\n\nVulnerability\nVulnerability in the context of climate change is the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes.\n\n\nClimate variability\nClimate variability is the way aspects of climate (such as temperature and precipitation) differ from an average. Climate variability occurs due to natural and sometimes periodic changes in the circulation of the air and ocean, volcanic eruptions, and other factors.\nClimate variability is often natural, however climate change is causing an increase in the probability of many extreme weather events, and those events contribute to climate variability.\n\n\nClimate mitigation\nDefined as reducing the rate of climate change, involves stemming the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere: Either by reducing sources of these gases (for example, the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, or transport) or enhancing the “sinks” that accumulate and store these gases (such as the oceans, forests, and soil).\nThe goal of mitigation is to avoid significant human (anthropogenic) interference with Earth’s climate, “stabilise greenhouse gas levels in a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, ensure that food production is not threatened, and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner” excerpt from 2014 report on Mitigation of Climate Change from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, page 4."

Incidentally, those who have danced this dance before may recognise a familiar framework. Thing is … Can anyone put a name to it?\nBefore we deep dive allow me to dream some. Am hoping by the end of its timeline, LM4eJ will have enhanced competencies within Environment Tobago for it to conduct national and regional Climate Change vulnerability assessments in the context of the UN’s Adaptation Policy Framework. Enhancing the competencies of Environment Tobago is by design a function of the LM4eJ objectives."

Utilise funds in a balanced way; in tune with the Tobago context and its living standards.\n\nBudget lines:\n\nTransport; estimate how much travel is involved and then budget for it.\nEquipment; (photographic, laptops, recorders, batteries, first-aid kit, or any other as required) and stationery (flipcharts, markers, index cards, notebooks, etc); Make a list of what will be required, acquire quotations and prepare estimates well before committing to the project.\nDaily expenses of facilitation team members; estimate what will be necessary to support carrying out the work effectively.\nConsider a provision for meals, tea/coffee and snacks, and related catering arrangements. Estimate days required, who will supply it and the required food items. Consider if there will be any community-wide events requiring substantial catering, such as at the PVA process on outset and/or completion. Discuss with the community how this is to be best arranged as well as their funding requirements if they want to cater/host.\nBudget for sundry expenses related to the PVA. For example, paying for transport of community members to participate in the PVA; or paying somebody to relieve women of their household tasks so that they are free to engage in the PVA. Make allowances for sundries which cannot be anticipated.\nBudget for services which cannot be done in-house such as GIS mapping, modeling, biodiversity mapping or radio announcements or legal services.\nBudget for a proportion of staff wages to come out of this budget - as percentile of time allocated. Include the cost of reporting (financial and the technical VA output)"
