VA’s are a tool for gauging resiliency of a community. VA’s use a plethora of devices to arrive at a result: Which we will discuss enroute to advocating for the community of Lambeau.\nSome background. Environment Tobago had done a mini Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment (VCA) in the Lambeau/Petit Trou geography as part of the project titled “Action by Civil Society in Trinidad and Tobago to Build Resilience to Climate Change project (2015 - 2017), with support from Conservation International and BHP Billiton Trinidad and Tobago”.\nMore recently (Dec 2023) we participated in a 4 day workshop for 14 countries from the region to acquire skills as trainers of VCA trainers. Both sessions as well as others too numerous to mention were facilitated by the Caribbean Natural Resources Institute. From this writers perspective therefore, ET is capable of conducting the necessary works to gauge the impact of February’s disaster on the village of Lambeau."

    "section": "Spatial mapping",
    "text": "Spatial mapping\nUse a wide format printout (or have a good hand drawn outline map made) that the target group can circulate around. (Requires a suitable table) Have the target group enter the geography as they know it.\nFor example people could ‘place’ the school’s location, the fish retail outlet, the Pascal village stream, the hotel ruin, the bridges, the Shore Things restaurant and curio shoppe. All together such information - even tho its of diffrent things, comprise a spatial mapping exercise.\n\n3D modeling\nParticipatory three-dimensional modelling (P3DM) is another tool that uses local knowledge to assess vulnerability and identify possible adaptation strategies. It facilitates the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders, such as community members, government ministers, technical persons, civil society and academia, in the process of assessing vulnerabilities in the areas where they live and work.\nThe three-dimensional model can be used to depict the past, present and future and is therefore a good tool to show the impacts of climate change and to plan for adaptation and resilience building. As the model is produced to scale, the information collected can be digitised and placed into a geographic information system (GIS) and used by a variety of planners to support decision-making. P3DM however, takes time to complete (typically between two weeks and two months).\n\n\nPhoto journaling\nIs effective for our purposes as it allows for anyone (with a camera) to submit content. Allows for non current imagery to be display - which can also substantiate the historical timeline.\nA photo journal is easy for us to share and easy for the receivers to consume when they do get it. Can also be used in other exercises over time.\n\n\nVideo journaling\nParticipatory video (PV) is a tool that can be used by community stakeholders to make their own video to tell the story of their vulnerability and capacity to adapt to climate change. It gives the community a direct voice using a very powerful communication medium that brings their challenges and issues alive for a wider audience.\nPV can be useful for supporting advocacy, building consensus and exchange of ideas and experiences between groups or communities, including facilitating dialogue between groups, communities and stakeholders from outside the community. It can also be used for participatory monitoring and evaluation.\nPV is not traditional documentary film-making. Community stakeholders are fully involved in all stages of the production of the video. The persons involved in the PV often move from being the “object of study” to become the “subject” of the process.\nThis enhances the participants’ motivation and attitude to take action. They decide what the issues and questions are, who should be part of the process, who needs to hear the messages and how those messages should be crafted and possible solutions. This includes creating a storyboard, capturing video clips of interviews with stakeholders and scene shots and direct editing of the video clips. The final product may take the format of a documentary, a skit or a music video.\n\n\n Surveys\nSurveys can provide insights into people’s level of awareness of climate change and its impacts, the types of strategies for addressing impacts, and the various resources available in a community or sector.\nYou can ask questions that provide quantitative information (numbers and facts), such as household size, sources and level of income, or how often a community is affected by a particular climate hazard.\nYou should also include questions that provide qualitative information (descriptions), such as perceptions and attitudes about an issue.\nSurveys unlike semi-structured interviews and focus groups, typically use a rigid format where participants are asked the same questions in the same order. This fixed format ensures reliable and comparable information across the surveys.\nSurveys can be administered in a variety of ways, for example face-to-face, online (Meet, Zoom etc), via telephone or via mail or email).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for developing survey questions\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep them simple. Avoid using technical terms or jargon that may be poorly understood by respondents.\nBe concise. Avoid long questions with multiple elements. They can be confusing as respondents don’t know which part to answer.\nAvoid leading questions that direct participants to a particular answer. Instead of giving their honest opinion, participants will choose what they think is a good answer for you.\nAvoid loaded terms. Loaded terms, like corruption or fines, can result in a negative reaction regardless of the question asked.\nKeep the survey short: The quality of the responses will decline if it takes too long to get to the end of the survey.\nPilot the survey on a small scale before finalising and launching the full survey. This enables you to check that your selected interviewers have the necessary skills and respondents find the questions clear are providing the type of information you need.\n\n\n\nHere is the link to one survey we used in Lambeau during the 2017 VA\nAnd here is the link to the forthcoming LM4eJ survey This link is not active at this point but it will take you to a Google Form soon …\n\n\nLivelihood Analysis\nLivelihood vulnerability analysis is a systematic, participatory approach for analysing the vulnerability of a community’s livelihoods to climate change. It aims to engage the community in identifying how climate change is affecting their livelihoods, the drivers of vulnerability and ways to build resilient and sustainable livelihoods.\nThe analysis focuses not just on how community members earn a living, such as fishing, farming or tourism but also focuses on the wider concept of livelihoods assets and wellbeing. It also examines the opportunities and assets available to the community, and the different policies and institutions shaping these opportunities.\nThrough understanding the livelihood activities and assets within a community, you can analyse how they will be affected by climate change and the factors that make them more or less vulnerable. You can identify ways that communities can respond using their available assets. Additionally, you can identify entry points for building adaptive capacity and resilience into the future.\n\n\nValue Chain Analysis\n“Identifying key stages in an enterprise. It shows for example the steps from sourcing raw material for the product (and/or service), to sale, to the final consumer. It is used to improve the bottom line of an enterprise by adding value to its product or service” (Arline, 2016).\nNext up …. Objectives and Activities"

Obviously Government will extract its expenditure (fronted) towards the 2024 cleanup but the restoration should be managed by Tobago/ i.e. the Lambeau community.\nWhat is unsaid is, Environment Tobago in empowering the cause of the Lambeau community is living up to its role as an advocate for environmental justice. Remember, Lambeau did not cause the February oil spill. They are simply victims of an injustice.\nHow  does Environment Tobago benefit the organisation or it members in oil spill involvement, beyond ‘just’ simply cleaning coast and wiping oil of wildlife?\nThis NGO’s strategic plan provides guidance (or strongly suggests) that we need an item that can generate income for the operations of the group: Preferably in a niche that is not overly popular and therefore highly competitive.\nThe oil spill has occurred at time when Environment Tobago has to hand, capability to assess and guide the Lambeau community to a place less vulnerable to unplanned disaster. And to greater appreciation of the Risks they face from the rapid onset of changing climate, given their proximity to the open ocean.\nIn short, the opportunity provided by the oil spill is something ET is uniquely placed to capture.

There will be other groups that can be impacted so the exhaustive list should be generated by consultation with the community and stakeholders - wherever found.\nThis opens up the option of pressing litigation against the THA. It also mean proving any arguments we make.\nWe’d want to argue the event could have been forestalled had the coast guard been doing their work. As the Prime Minister the Hon. Keith Rowley is on record as admitting the TTCG is having vessel issues. We could also make a case that State is in dereliction of duty. For which we use satellite tracking data that ‘put’ the leaking barge off Trinidad but well within our waters prior to dropping in at Cove.\nThe core argument is that the disaster could have been prevented had State’s resources functioned when tested in early February.

    "text": "Budget period == 90 Days\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide the budget. Do not spend unnecessarily but also do not be thrifty at the expense of safety, comfort and well-being of the facilitation team and community participants. Utilise funds in a balanced way; in tune with the Tobago context and its living standards.\n\nBudget lines:\n\nTransport; estimate how much travel is involved and then budget for it.\nEquipment; (photographic, laptops, recorders, batteries, first-aid kit, or any other as required) and stationery (flipcharts, markers, index cards, notebooks, etc); Make a list of what will be required, acquire quotations and prepare estimates well before committing to the project.\nDaily expenses of facilitation team members; estimate what will be necessary to support carrying out the work effectively.\nConsider a provision for meals, tea/coffee and snacks, and related catering arrangements. Estimate days required, who will supply it and the required food items. Consider if there will be any community-wide events requiring substantial catering, such as at the PVA process on outset and/or completion. Discuss with the community how this is to be best arranged as well as their funding requirements if they want to cater/host.\nBudget for sundry expenses related to the PVA. For example, paying for transport of community members to participate in the PVA; or paying somebody to relieve women of their household tasks so that they are free to engage in the PVA. Make allowances for sundries which cannot be anticipated.\nBudget for services which cannot be done in-house such as GIS mapping, modeling, biodiversity mapping or radio announcements or legal services.\nBudget for a proportion of staff wages to come out of this budget - as percentile of time allocated. Include the cost of reporting (financial and the technical VA output)"
